<p>We are mHACKeroni, an Italian "ethical hacking" team.</p>
<p>Our "mega-team" is a joint collaboration between 5 Italian CTF teams, which merged together to sum their streghts and ultimately try to achieve DEFCON CTF Finals qualification:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://toh.necst.it">Tower of Hanoi</a> from Politecnico di Milano</li>
		<li><a href="https://secgroup.github.io">c00kies@venice</a> from the University of Venice Ca' Foscari</li>
		<li><a href="http://spritz.math.unipd.it/spritzers.html">spritzers</a> from the University of Padua</li>
		<li><a href="https://theromanxpl0it.github.io/">TheRomanXpl0it</a> from Sapienza University of Rome</li>
		<li><a href="https://jbzteam.github.io/about/">JBZ</a>, an independent team</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>On May 12-13 2018, in a tremendous team effort, we scored second place on the DEF CON Capture The Flag qualifiers over 600 teams from all over the world. This result gained us access to the DEF CON CTF finals, on August 9-12, in Las Vegas, USA.</p>
